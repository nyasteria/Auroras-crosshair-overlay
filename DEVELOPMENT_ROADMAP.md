  - Position adjusters (X, Y)
- [ ] Add hide/show toggle (key: Tab)
- [ ] Save/load settings to JSON

**Estimated**: 2-3 weeks

## v1.2: Configuration System

### JSON Configuration File
- [ ] Create config file format
```json
{
  "crosshair": "default.png",
  "position": { "x": 960, "y": 540 },
  "scale": 1.0,
  "color": { "r": 0.0, "g": 1.0, "b": 0.0, "a": 1.0 },
  "opacity": 1.0,
  "hotkeys": {
    "toggle": "Tab",
    "cycleNext": "Right",
    "cyclePrev": "Left"
  }
}
```
- [ ] Implement config loader/saver
- [ ] Add config validation
- [ ] Auto-load on startup

### Hotkey System
- [ ] Register global hotkeys
  - Toggle visibility (Tab)
  - Cycle to next crosshair (Right Arrow)
  - Cycle to previous crosshair (Left Arrow)
  - Increase scale (Up Arrow)
  - Decrease scale (Down Arrow)
- [ ] Conflict detection
- [ ] Customizable hotkeys via config

**Estimated**: 2 weeks

---

## v1.3: Enhanced Features

- [ ] Crosshair suggestion based on game
- [ ] Sensitivity converter

### Integration
- [ ] Game-specific profiles
- [ ] Discord Rich Presence
- [ ] Streaming platform integration
- [ ] Accessibility features

### Community
- [ ] Contributor guidelines

## Implementation Priority

### Must Have (MVP)
1. PNG loading ✅ (v1.1)
2. ImGui UI ✅ (v1.1)
3. Configuration file ✅ (v1.2)
4. Hotkey system ✅ (v1.2)

### Should Have
5. Multi-monitor support (v1.3)
6. Performance optimization (v1.3)
7. Color presets (v1.4)
8. Profile system (v1.4)

### Nice to Have
9. Advanced effects (v1.4)
10. Tray integration (v2.0)
11. Crosshair marketplace (v2.0)

---

## Technical Debt

### Current Issues
- [ ] Shader compilation done at runtime (optimize)
- [ ] No error logging system
- [ ] No input validation on config loading
- [ ] Memory management could be improved

### Refactoring Needed
- [ ] Separate shader code into .hlsl files
- [ ] Create logging utility
- [ ] Add configuration validator
- [ ] Implement RAII patterns more thoroughly
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Config file parsing
- [ ] File discovery (crosshairs)
- [ ] Color validation
- [ ] Position clamping

### Integration Tests
- [ ] PNG loading workflow
- [ ] DirectX initialization
- [ ] Hotkey registration
- [ ] Config save/load cycle

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] CPU/GPU profiling
- [ ] Frame time consistency
- [ ] Stress testing (many crosshairs)
